# SQL-Merge-Statement-Generator
The idea is, to generate complex and large sql merge statement with a function

# Usage
Just copy the contents of the file merge_generator to your sql editor.
Then replace the 2 variables with the target schema and table name.
Run the whole thing. The output has to be edited, too.

In the output there are 4 points to be edited.

When done, you have a merge statement for a target table including the feature that a Create_Date and a Last_Update_Date column in the target table will be treated in an expected way.

Good luck, Jens
